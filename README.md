## The Story So Far...

*Deanu* and *Behru* are two evil supervillians (famous among all), hell bent on destroying the peace of the young minds of different colleges, by illegally hacking the attendance databases and modifying everyone's attendance to very low percentages. They keep covering their tracks and are almost impossible to catch. 

*HackerDB* is a student-led organization dedicated for cyber-securing the youth. They have taken upon them to bring an end to Deanu and Behru's metasploits.

**HackerDB now requires your assistance to bring them to justice.**
