# Fork your way to victory with GIT !
## IIT Mandi Git Hero 2022
We welcome you all to Git Hero 2022


## Plot
There are two friends, Paddu and Vicku (you know who they are ;P).

Hint: Paddu is a pro level comder while Vicku is a graphic designing gawd.

Vicku is a very short-tempered guy. Interestingly, Vicku got infected with a deadly and contagious disease ‘F’. As he was in quarantine and was feeling agitated, there are chances that he might come out and spread the disease throughout the campus. So, his good friend Paddu, in an attempt to stop Vicku, developed a game. But, there are some bugs in the game that need to be fixed and Vicku is a noob when it comes to using git.

If Vicku is not able to play the game, he will come out of his quarantine and spread the disease throughout the campus. Hence, in order to stop this madness and save yourself from getting infected by ‘F’, you need to help Vicku in removing bugs from the game.
